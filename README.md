# nvim-wordhighlighter
A Neovim plugin to highlight programming symbols with 8 distinct colors.

## Features
- Highlights programming symbols
- 8 high-contrast colors
- Toggles highlights with `<leader>m`  (clear highlight if already toggled)
- Clears all colors with `<leader>M`
- If colors are drained, there will be a notify "No more colors available! (Max 8 highlighted words)"
- Then, either you have to manually select one color to free (toggle action), or you have to clear all colors

## Future improve
- Pop a window for us to select which one to remove highlight 
- OR, recycle the color: the first color get used will be deprived for current applying

## Notice
- This plugin is tested by me, but totally written by Doubao (https://www.doubao.com)
- My first github project was done by AI ^-^
